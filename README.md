# LLM-Learning

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my journey in learning Large Language Models (LLMs), utilizing OpenAI's API, fine-tuning models, and using Hugging Face's models and datasets. This repository also includes the development of an AI chatbot.

## Introduction

In this repository, I document my learning process and projects related to Large Language Models (LLMs). The focus areas include:
- Utilizing OpenAI's API for various NLP tasks.
- Fine-tuning models using Hugging Face's transformers and datasets.
- Developing an AI chatbot that leverages these models.

### Usage

Each project directory contains its own set of instructions and usage details. Refer to the README files in each project directory for more information.

## Projects

### OpenAI API Utilization

In this project, I explore various use cases of OpenAI's API, including text generation, completion, and more.

### Hugging Face Models and Datasets

This project focuses on fine-tuning Hugging Face's models with various datasets. It includes scripts and notebooks demonstrating the process.

### AI Chatbot Development

This is a comprehensive project where I develop an AI chatbot. The chatbot uses fine-tuned models and can perform various conversational tasks.
